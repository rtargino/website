  abstract = {Pension fund populations often have mortality experiences that are substantially different from the national benchmark. In a motivating case study of Brazilian corporate pension funds, pensioners are observed to have mortality that is 40-55\% below the national average, due to the underlying socioeconomic disparities. Direct analysis of a pension fund population is challenging due to very sparse data, with age-specific annual death counts often in low single digits. We design and study a collection of stochastic sub-population frameworks that coherently capture and project pensioner mortality rates via deflator factors relative to a reference population. Superseding parametric approaches, we propose Gaussian process (GP) based models that flexibly estimate Age- and/or Year-specific deflators. We demonstrate that the GP models achieve better goodness of fit and uncertainty quantification. Our models are illustrated on two Brazilian pension funds in the context of exogenous national and insurance industry mortality tables. The GP models are implemented in R Stan using a fully Bayesian approach and take into account over-dispersion relative to the Poisson likelihood.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. This remarkable ability may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et al. (2021), shifting the focus from a "learning" problem to a "sampling" problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently encountered in Bayesian statistics.},
