In this work, we propose a numerical framework that uses only simulations of returns for estimating risk budgeting portfolios. Specifically, we provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) algorithm with cutting planes, and a Stochastic Gradient Decent algorithm, tailored to the risk budgeting portfolio for the Expected Shortfall. We illustrate different risk budgeting portfolios, constructed using a especially designed Julia package, on real financial data and compare it to classical portfolio strategies.}

  abstract = {In this talk I will discuss the process of risk allocation for a generic multivariate model when the risk measure is chosen as the Value-at-Risk (VaR). We recast the traditional Euler contributions from an expectation conditional on an event of zero probability to a ratio involving conditional expectations whose conditioning events have strictly positive probability. We derive an analytical form of the proposed representation of VaR contributions for various parametric models. Our numerical experiments show that the estimator using this novel representation outperforms the standard Monte Carlo estimator in terms of bias and variance. Moreover, unlike the existing estimators, the proposed estimator is free from hyperparameters under a parametric setting.}

  abstract = {Large pension plans face the difficulty of investing premiums in a financially prudent but economically efficient way. An investment concept used in industry, e.g., by pension funds, is *risk budgeting portfolios* (RBP). RBP are diversified portfolios where the diversification is on the level of the risk contribution of each asset to the risk of the total portfolio loss. In this work, we assess the risk of the portfolio via a coherent risk measure, such as the Expected Shortfall. The risk contribution of an asset, is then the added risk of marginally increasing the portfolio's position in that asset. Hence, risk budgeting portfolios are diversified in terms of the risk stemming from each asset and therefore ideal for pension plans which face stringent investment requirements.
  Advances in the academic literature and practical implementations of RBP strategies, however, make the strong assumption that assets are multivariate Gaussian. We propose an efficient stochastic optimization framework that calculates RBP for assets with arbitrary joint distribution. Moreover, the RBP is constructed using only sampled scenarios, making it applicable in a variety of settings such as data-driven statistical models, arbitrary dependency structures, and internal loss models.}

In the first part, accessible to the general public, I will describe the economic uncertainty index and its Brazilian version, developed and calculated by FGV. In the second part, we use Bayesian inference methods for missing data in asynchronous freedom of the press data and show that the economic uncertainty index is, in a way, orthogonal to the volatility of the stock indexes of the local markets. In the last part of the talk I will present our advances in the direction of improving this and other word-based indexes, where we use Bayesian methods of particle filters to understand the importance of each word in the construction of an index.}
