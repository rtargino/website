title = {Risk-Budgeted Mean Variance Portfolios },
year={2025},
month={04},
day={30},
url={},
abstract={We introduce the Risk-Budgeted Mean-Variance (RBMV) portfolio, a novel framework that
connects the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem and the risk budgeting approach. By
modifying the risk budgeting optimization problem to include constraints on expected returns
and volatility, RBMV offers a disciplined way to manage the trade-off between risk concentration
and return maximization. The investor gains a lever to adjust how close the portfolio sits to either
framework, depending on her preferences. We show that the optimization problem that defines
the RBMV portfolio is convex, efficiently computable, and typically delivers competitive returns
with reduced risk concentration in the context of long-only portfolios. We illustrate our methodology
using daily equity returns from the U.S. and show that our methodology efficiently controls
the volatility of returns while also delivering Sharpe ratios that are consistently higher than the
traditional mean-variance approach.}

title = {Challenges in actuarial learning for loss modeling of Brazilian soybean crops},
year={2025},
month={02},
day={10},
url={},
abstract={Agriculture accounts for 25% of Brazil's GDP, with soybeans being the most significant crop, yielding over 150 million tons in 2022/2023. However, soybean production is highly vulnerable to climate factors like drought and excessive rainfall, which impact yields and crop insurance pricing. This study uses actuarial learning models to predict soybean losses, incorporating weather variables such as rainfall and temperature. Generalized linear models and random forests are benchmarked within a two-stage frequency-severity framework for claim occurrence and severity prediction. We compare charged premiums with estimated premiums and conduct stress tests to assess weather-related risks during extreme events, such as those observed in the crop year 2022/23 in the Brazilian South and Central-West regions.}

title = {Mortality Forecasting of Small Pension Fund Population with Gaussian Processes in a Sub Population Framework},
year={2024},
month={12},
day={02},
url={},
abstract={In order to assess the financial condition of a pension fund, one needs to take into account the mortality forecast so the longevity risk is considered in a consistent way on future cash flows. Usually, the forecast of mortality rates is performed with national or country population data. Even in the presence of basis risk when applying it for pension funds sub-populations (selected populations), for most of the countries this may not be a meaningful problem. However, for countries with relevant social inequalities and a heterogeneous population, national mortality rates may be quite different and more severe than the ones observed in selected sub-populations. In this paper, we use Gaussian processes in a spatial covariance framework applied to sub-population frameworks such that reference populations are used. The applications are performed with a time series of a Brazilian small pension fund population along with the annual country mortality table and also with the use of a public non-periodic insurance industry mortality table. Our aim is to coherently forecast longevity scenarios for the pension fund population. The GP models were implemented in Stan in a Bayesian approach in R statistical package.}

We recast the traditional Euler contributions from an expectation conditional on an event of zero probability to a ratio involving conditional expectations whose conditioning events have strictly positive probability. We derive an analytical form of the proposed representation of VaR contributions for various parametric models. Our numerical experiments show that the estimator using this novel representation outperforms the standard Monte Carlo estimator in terms of bias and variance. Moreover, unlike the existing estimators, the proposed estimator is free from hyperparameters under a parametric setting.}

An investment concept used in industry, e.g., by pension funds, is *risk budgeting portfolios* (RBP). RBP are diversified portfolios where the diversification is on the level of the risk contribution of each asset to the risk of the total portfolio loss. In this work, we assess the risk of the portfolio via a coherent risk measure, such as the Expected Shortfall. The risk contribution of an asset, is then the added risk of marginally increasing the portfolio's position in that asset. Hence, risk budgeting portfolios are diversified in terms of the risk stemming from each asset and therefore ideal for pension plans which face stringent investment requirements.
  Advances in the academic literature and practical implementations of RBP strategies, however, make the strong assumption that assets are multivariate Gaussian. We propose an efficient stochastic optimization framework that calculates RBP for assets with arbitrary joint distribution. Moreover, the RBP is constructed using only sampled scenarios, making it applicable in a variety of settings such as data-driven statistical models, arbitrary dependency structures, and internal loss models.}
