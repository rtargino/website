        "abstract": "Agriculture accounts for 25% of Brazil's GDP, with soybeans being the most significant crop, yielding over 150 million tons in 2022/2023. However, soybean production is highly vulnerable to climate factors like drought and excessive rainfall, which impact yields and crop insurance pricing. This study uses actuarial learning models to predict soybean losses, incorporating weather variables such as rainfall and temperature. Generalized linear models and random forests are benchmarked within a two-stage frequency-severity framework for claim occurrence and severity prediction. We compare charged premiums with estimated premiums and conduct stress tests to assess weather-related risks during extreme events, such as those observed in the crop year 2022/23 in the Brazilian South and Central-West regions.",

We derive an analytical form of the proposed representation of VaR contributions for various parametric models. Our numerical experiments show that the estimator using this novel representation outperforms the standard Monte Carlo estimator in terms of bias and variance. Moreover, unlike the existing estimators, the proposed estimator is free from hyperparameters under a parametric setting.",

Sampling from a factor copula is equivalent to sampling from the factor model and applying the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) to each component of the sample. Nonetheless, in many models of interest the c.d.f.'s are not explicitly known. In this talk I'll present theoretical and numerical properties of a transform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme developed to efficiently compute expectations conditional to rare events in which the unconditional distribution is given by an intractable factor copula.",

An investment concept used in industry, e.g., by pension funds, is *risk budgeting portfolios* (RBP). RBP are diversified portfolios where the diversification is on the level of the risk contribution of each asset to the risk of the total portfolio loss. In this work, we assess the risk of the portfolio via a coherent risk measure, such as the Expected Shortfall. The risk contribution of an asset, is then the added risk of marginally increasing the portfolio's position in that asset. Hence, risk budgeting portfolios are diversified in terms of the risk stemming from each asset and therefore ideal for pension plans which face stringent investment requirements.\nAdvances in the academic literature and practical implementations of RBP strategies, however, make the strong assumption that assets are multivariate Gaussian. We propose an efficient stochastic optimization framework that calculates RBP for assets with arbitrary joint distribution. Moreover, the RBP is constructed using only sampled scenarios, making it applicable in a variety of settings such as data-driven statistical models, arbitrary dependency structures, and internal loss models.",

        "abstract": "This talk is concerned with the process of risk allocation for a generic multivariate model when the risk measure is chosen as the Value-at-Risk (VaR). We recast the traditional Euler contributions from an expectation conditional to an event of zero probability to a ratio of conditional expectations, where both the numerator and the denominator's conditioning events have positive probability. For several different models we show empirically that the estimator using this novel representation has no perceivable bias and variance smaller than a standard estimator used in practice.",

In the second part, we use Bayesian inference methods for missing data in asynchronous freedom of the press data and show that the economic uncertainty index is, in a way, orthogonal to the volatility of the stock indexes of the local markets. In the last part of the talk I will present our advances in the direction of improving this and other word-based indexes, where we use Bayesian methods of particle filters to understand the importance of each word in the construction of an index.",
