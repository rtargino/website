        "abstract": "Risk budgeting is a portfolio strategy where each asset contributes a prespecified amount to the aggregate risk of the portfolio. In this work, we propose a numerical framework that uses only simulations of returns for estimating risk budgeting portfolios. Specifically, we provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) algorithm with cutting planes, and a Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) algorithm, tailored to the risk budgeting portfolio for the Expected Shortfall. We illustrate different risk budgeting portfolios, constructed using a especially designed Julia package, on real financial data and compare it to classical portfolio strategies.",

        "abstract": "In financial risk management, modelling dependency within a random vector X is crucial, a standard approach is the use of a copula model. Say the copula model can be sampled through realizations of X having copula function C: had the marginals of Y been known, sampling Xi, the i-th component of X, would directly follow by composing Yi with its cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) and the inverse c.d.f. of Xi. In this work, the marginals of Y are not explicit, as in a factor copula model. We design an algorithm which samples X through an empirical approximation of the c.d.f. of the Y-marginals. To be able to handle complex distributions for Y or rare-event computations, we allow Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. We establish convergence results whose rates depend on the tails of X, Y and the Lyapunov function of the MCMC sampler. We present numerical experiments confirming the convergence rates and also revisit a real data analysis from financial risk management.",

Making use of Malliavin calculus, we recast the traditional Euler contributions from an expectation conditional to an event of zero probability to a ratio of conditional expectations, where both the numerator and the denominator's conditioning events have positive probability. For several different models we show empirically that the estimator using this novel representation has no perceivable bias and variance smaller than a standard estimator used in practice.",

An important ingredient of the proposed method is the Cuchiero–Teichmann volatility estimator, which is based on Fourier transforms and provides a continuous-time estimate of the latent process. This estimate is then used to construct an approximate likelihood for the parameters of interest, whose restrictions are taken into account through prior distributions. The procedure is shown to be highly successful for constructing the posterior distribution of the parameters of a Heston model, while limited success is achieved when applied to the highly parametrized exponential-Ornstein–Uhlenbeck.",

In particular, a novel Monte Carlo method to calculate capital allocations for a general insurance company is developed, with a focus on coherent capital allocation that is compliant with the Swiss Solvency Test. The data used is based on the balance sheet of a representative stylized company. For each line of business in that company, allocations are calculated for the one-year risk with dependencies based on correlations given by the Swiss Solvency Test. Two different approaches for dealing with parameter uncertainty are discussed and simulation algorithms based on (pseudo-marginal) Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms are described and their efficiency is analysed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate how to develop analytic closed form solutions to optimal multiple stopping time problems arising in the setting in which the value function acts on a compound process that is modified by the actions taken at the stopping times. This class of problem is particularly relevant in insurance and risk management settings and we demonstrate this on an important application domain based on insurance strategies in Operational Risk management for financial institutions. In this area of risk management the most prevalent class of loss process models is the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) framework which involves modelling annual losses via a compound process. Given an LDA model framework, we consider Operational Risk insurance products that mitigate the risk for such loss processes and may reduce capital requirements. In particular, we consider insurance products that grant the policy holder the right to insure k of its annual Operational losses in a horizon of T years. We consider two insurance product structures and two general model settings, the first are families of relevant LDA loss models that we can obtain closed form optimal stopping rules for under each generic insurance mitigation structure and then secondly classes of LDA models for which we can develop closed form approximations of the optimal stopping rules. In particular, for losses following a compound Poisson process with jump size given by an Inverse-Gaussian distribution and two generic types of insurance mitigation, we are able to derive analytic expressions for the loss process modified by the insurance application, as well as closed form solutions for the optimal multiple stopping rules in discrete time (annually). When the combination of insurance mitigation and jump size distribution does not lead to tractable stopping rules we develop a principled class of closed form approximations to the optimal decision rule. These approximations are developed based on a class of orthogonal Askey polynomial series basis expansion representations of the annual loss compound process distribution and functions of this annual loss.",

The Euler (or gradient) principle, then, states that the capital to be allocated to each component of the portfolio has to be calculated as an expectation conditional to a rare event, which can be challenging to evaluate in practice. We exploit the copula-dependence within the portfolio risks to design a Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers based estimate to the marginal conditional expectations involved in the problem, showing its efficiency through a series of computational examples.",

        "abstract": "We set the context for capital approximation within the framework of the Basel II / III regulatory capital accords. This is particularly topical as the Basel III accord is shortly due to take effect. In this regard, we provide a summary of the role of capital adequacy in the new accord, highlighting along the way the significant loss events that have been attributed to the Operational Risk class that was introduced in the Basel II and III accords. Then we provide a semi-tutorial discussion on the modelling aspects of capital estimation under a Loss Distributional Approach (LDA). Our emphasis is to focus on the important loss processes with regard to those that contribute most to capital, the so called high consequence, low frequency loss processes. This leads us to provide a tutorial overview of heavy tailed loss process modelling in OpRisk under Basel III, with discussion on the implications of such tail assumptions for the severity model in an LDA structure. This provides practitioners with a clear understanding of the features that they may wish to consider when developing OpRisk severity models in practice. From this discussion on heavy tailed severity models, we then develop an understanding of the impact such models have on the right tail asymptotics of the compound loss process and we provide detailed presentation of what are known as first and second order tail approximations for the resulting heavy tailed loss process. From this we develop a tutorial on three key families of risk measures and their equivalent second order asymptotic approximations: Value-at-Risk (Basel III industry standard); Expected Shortfall (ES) and the Spectral Risk Measure. These then form the capital approximations.",
