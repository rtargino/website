        "abstract": "Pension fund populations often have mortality experiences that are substantially different from the national benchmark. In a motivating case study of Brazilian corporate pension funds, pensioners are observed to have mortality that is 40-55\\% below the national average, due to the underlying socioeconomic disparities. Direct analysis of a pension fund population is challenging due to very sparse data, with age-specific annual death counts often in low single digits. We design and study a collection of stochastic sub-population frameworks that coherently capture and project pensioner mortality rates via deflator factors relative to a reference population. Superseding parametric approaches, we propose Gaussian process (GP) based models that flexibly estimate Age- and/or Year-specific deflators. We demonstrate that the GP models achieve better goodness of fit and uncertainty quantification. Our models are illustrated on two Brazilian pension funds in the context of exogenous national and insurance industry mortality tables. The GP models are implemented in R Stan using a fully Bayesian approach and take into account over-dispersion relative to the Poisson likelihood.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. This remarkable ability may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et al. (2021), shifting the focus from a \"learning\" problem to a \"sampling\" problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently encountered in Bayesian statistics.",

        "abstract": "For the assessment of the financial soundness of a pension fund, it is necessary to take into account mortality forecasting so that longevity risk is consistently incorporated into future cash flows. In this article, we employ machine learning models applied to actuarial science (actuarial learning) to make mortality predictions for a relevant sample of pension funds' participants. Actuarial learning represents an emerging field that involves the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in actuarial science. This encompasses the use of algorithms and computational models to analyze large sets of actuarial data, such as regression trees, random forest, boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, and neural networks (eg. FNN, LSTM, and MHA). Our results indicate that some ML/AI algorithms present competitive out-ofsample performance when compared to the classical Lee-Carter model. This may indicate interesting alternatives for consistent liability evaluation and effective pension fund risk management.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a general framework for stochastic modeling of goals and other events in football (soccer) matches. The events are modelled as Cox processes (doubly stochastic Poisson processes) where the event intensities may depend on all the modeled events as well as external factors. The model has a strictly concave log-likelihood function which facilitates its fitting to observed data. Besides event times, the model describes the random lengths of stoppage times which can have a strong influence on the final score of a match. The model is illustrated on eight years of data from Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Série A. We find that dynamic regressors significantly improve the in-game predictive power of the model. In particular, a) when a team receives a red card, its goal intensity decreases more than 30\\%; b) the goal rate of a team increases by 10\\% if it is losing by one goal and by 20\\% if its losing by two goals; and c) when the goal difference at the end of the second half is less than or equal to one, the stoppage time is on average more than one minute longer than in matches with a difference of two goals.",

The effectiveness of the framework is showcased with simulated and real datasets. When the underlying severity model is a random forest, we extend the two-stage split conformal prediction procedure, showing how the out-of-bag mechanism can be leveraged to eliminate the need for a calibration set and to enable the production of prediction intervals with adaptive width.",
