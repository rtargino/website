 abstract = {We introduce the Risk-Budgeted Mean-Variance (RBMV) portfolio, a novel framework that
connects the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem and the risk budgeting approach. By
modifying the risk budgeting optimization problem to include constraints on expected returns
and volatility, RBMV offers a disciplined way to manage the trade-off between risk concentration
and return maximization. The investor gains a lever to adjust how close the portfolio sits to either
framework, depending on her preferences. We show that the optimization problem that defines
the RBMV portfolio is convex, efficiently computable, and typically delivers competitive returns
with reduced risk concentration in the context of long-only portfolios. We illustrate our methodology
using daily equity returns from the U.S. and show that our methodology efficiently controls
the volatility of returns while also delivering Sharpe ratios that are consistently higher than the
traditional mean-variance approach.},
