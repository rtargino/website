 abstract = {Agriculture accounts for 25% of Brazil's GDP, with soybeans being the most significant crop, yielding over 150 million tons in 2022/2023. However, soybean production is highly vulnerable to climate factors like drought and excessive rainfall, which impact yields and crop insurance pricing. This study uses actuarial learning models to predict soybean losses, incorporating weather variables such as rainfall and temperature. Generalized linear models and random forests are benchmarked within a two-stage frequency-severity framework for claim occurrence and severity prediction. We compare charged premiums with estimated premiums and conduct stress tests to assess weather-related risks during extreme events, such as those observed in the crop year 2022/23 in the Brazilian South and Central-West regions.},
