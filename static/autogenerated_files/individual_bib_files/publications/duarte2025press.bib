 abstract = {This study establishes press freedom as a novel financial risk factor by demonstrating its systematic effects on economic policy uncertainty and market volatility. Drawing on data from Freedom Houseâ€™s Freedom of the Press annual report across 12 countries, a Bayesian vector autoregression model is employed to infer a monthly implied measure of press freedom risk, enabling real-time tracking of its impact on financial markets. The findings reveal that press freedom shocks systematically increase economic policy uncertainty, particularly in politically sensitive economies, while their effect on market volatility varies: Some markets experience short-term stability due to information suppression, but instability rises in the long run. Moreover, press restrictions intensify during economic downturns, suggesting a procyclical link between media control and financial instability. These results underscore the importance of integrating press freedom risk into financial models, as constraints on media independence affect sovereign spreads, equity markets, and asset allocation decisions. Understanding this risk can help investors anticipate uncertainty spikes, refine hedging strategies, and enhance portfolio resilience in politically fragile markets.},
